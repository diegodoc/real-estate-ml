# Modeling

This document describes the machine learning models used for Titanic survival prediction.

## Model Selection
We evaluate several classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines

## Training Process
Models are trained using:
- Cross-validation with 5 folds
- Hyperparameter tuning via grid search
- Class balancing techniques

## Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC

## Model Comparison
A comparison of model performance with visualizations using Yellowbrick.
