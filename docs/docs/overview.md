# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project aims to predict Titanic survivors using machine learning techniques. The famous Titanic dataset provides passenger information including age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

## Objectives
- Build a machine learning model to predict passenger survival
- Analyze which factors most influenced survival rates
- Demonstrate a complete ML workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers including:
- Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Port of embarkation
- Survival (target variable)
